```
Let's define a system for representing geographical maps as a 2D array
comprised of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents "water" and 1 represents "land". For example:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 1

In this map, there are 3 islands, or groupings of land:
- - - - -
- a - a -
- a a a -
- - - - -
b - - c c

Please write a method that takes the 2D "map" array as an input and returns
the number of islands on the map as the output.
